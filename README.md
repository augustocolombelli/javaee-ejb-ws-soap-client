# JavaEE EJB - SOAP Client
Example of SOAP client. 

All classes in the webservice package were created in eclipse with the WSDL reference. For this, you need to create a new Java Project and add a new Web Service Client, using the WSDL reference (example: http://localhost:8080/javaee-ejb-ws-soap-server/PersonWS?wsdl).

The source of WS is disponible in this repository: https://github.com/augustocolombelli/javaee-ejb-ws-soap-server
